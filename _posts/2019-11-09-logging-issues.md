In this post, we'll be solving our first EVABS level: **Debug**, which deals with the sensitive data logging issues in Android applications.

**Level: 1**
**Points: 10**
**Difficulty: Easy**

## Preface

[**Logging**](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log) is a generic feature that has been in use in software development life cycles for many years. They are important to understand what is happening in the background of a running software. Logs also provide essential intel while identifying issues/errors.  

Android also provides this feature using which you can test your application's working and debug it incase you find any issues. Android provides a tool called the **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** which is a tool that can be installed on your computer (which you might have already done by now from the [first part](https://www.hawkspawn.com/blog/getting-started-with-evabs/) of this series) running Windows/Mac/Linux. ADB also ships with the default Android SDK that can be downloaded from the official [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) web page.
